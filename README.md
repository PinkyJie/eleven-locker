## Behind the scenes

- We constantly monitor the fuel prices (every half an hour right now).
- Once we find a new price, make sure we have couple of vouchers available in record for that price, if not, lock in new ones.
- Guarantee you always get the lowest price which is existed in last 7 days every time you visit, if not, lock in a fresh voucher with the current lowest price.
